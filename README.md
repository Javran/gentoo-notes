gentoo-notes
============

it's hard to remember everything about gentoo as well as linux. So here I keep notes for convenience.

Almost everything here can be found on Internet. 
However, if you have been tired of going through long docs just to make things work,
take a look at this repo.

I'll be ready to share everything that might be useful for a gentoo user.
