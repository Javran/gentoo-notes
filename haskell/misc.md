# Hackage Package Versioning Policy

* Version number should have the form `A.B.C[.D]`
* `A.B` must be greater when there are deletion, deprecation & modification on existing things
* `A.B.C` must be greater when new things are introduced

See [Package versioning policy](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Package_versioning_policy)
for detail.
